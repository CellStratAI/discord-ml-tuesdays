# ML Tuesdays

Every Tuesday, we host a live session on various topics of machine learning, deep learning and everything related to AI on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mWJzjyVfC9). It ranges from webinars to practices exercises you do yourself with a solution discussion afterwards. This repository is a collection of all the exercises and recordings of all the ML Tuesdays.

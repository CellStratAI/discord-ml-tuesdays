# ML Tuesdays

Every Tuesday, we host a live session on various topics of machine learning, deep learning and everything related to AI on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mWJzjyVfC9). It ranges from webinars to practices exercises you do yourself with a solution discussion afterwards. This repository is a collection of all the exercises and recordings of all the ML Tuesdays.

Join the [CellStrat Discord](https://discord.gg/mWJzjyVfC9) Now for a lot of Interactive Events!!

Sign Up on [CellStrat Hub](https://cellstrathub.com/), A Unified Ecosystem of Machine Learning Tools for Rapid Development, Deployment, and Launch. All the ML Tuesdays are done on CellStrat Hub Workspace, a hosted Jupyter Lab based development environment with persistent storage, realtime collaboration, dedicated VM and more.
